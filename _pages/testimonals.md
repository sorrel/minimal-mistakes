### Tessa and Mark Holland from [The Wild Fortune Quiet Garden](http://wildfortuneblog.blogspot.co.uk)
Heidi has been our gardener since September 2016. She is friendly, enthusiastic, professional and reliable and makes really helpful suggestions about planting and maintenance, working in harmony with the seasons and sympathy with our ethos. Thanks to her hard work over the last year or so, our woodland garden continues to thrive as a place of quiet and welcome.
