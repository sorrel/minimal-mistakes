## Heidi's Profile
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/general/about_heidi3.jpg" alt="Heidi in a garden" caption="" %}{: .align-right}
I have been gardening for most of my life and have had my own business since 2014. 

I have always had an interest in wildlife and the natural world - in making things grow and flourish. Beyond gardening as a career I tended several allotments where I've produce fruit, vegetables, cutting garden flowers and pollinator-friendly plants.

My gardening passions are for wildlife, herbaceous perennials and an organic approach to every aspect of plant care. Alongside gaining practical experience I have also studied and passed multiple RHS and other gardening qualifications. 

I take pride in all the gardens I work in and get great satisfaction working alongside and liaising with my clients so they get the very best from their gardens.I have been praised for my plant knowledge, reliability and enthusiasm. I am happiest when I am planting up an area, caring for it afterwards and watching the plants grow and thrive under my care.

Every client has their own ideas about how they would like me to care for their garden and I enjoy working with them to translate this into horticultural success.

Leaf & Seed have cared for a number of publically accessible gardens including:
 * *Haglands Lane*, West Chiltington
 * *The Roundabout Hotel*, West Chiltington
 * *Foxmead Court Retirement Homes*, Storrington
 * *Stag Cottage Bed & Breakfast*, Balls Cross

I am extremely proud to have had mys home garden recently photographed for a forthcoming feature in the RSPB magazine entitled: "*Nature's Choice: showcasing what can be achieved in a very small space*"; see the [Gallery]({% link _pages/gallery.md %}) page for photos from this.
