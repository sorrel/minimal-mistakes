**Leaf & Seed** was founded by Heidi Hurwood in 2014, to provide RHS Qualified and knowledgeable gardening services in the West Sussex area.

Heidi usually works with Duncan West, with profiles of both gardeners below.

## Heidi Hurwood

Heidi has been gardening for sixteen years, starting with her own allotment in the early 2000s followed by several years volunteering at Ryton Garden Organic before gardening professionally.

I have been a professional gardener for six years, gaining a wealth of experience in the many gardens I have cared for, with a particular focus on pruning. Every garden is different with:
 * a huge variety of plants 
 * different aspects and shading
 * varied soil types/nutrient requirements

Every client has their own ideas about how they would like me to care for their garden and I enjoy working with them to translate this into horticultural success. I liaise closely with my clients and have been praised for my plant knowledge, reliability and general interest.

Leaf & Seed have cared for a number of publically accessible gardens including:
 * *Haglands Lane*, West Chiltington
 * *The Roundabout Hotel*, West Chiltington
 * *Foxmead Court Retirement Homes*, Storrington
 * *Stag Cottage Bed & Breakfast*, Balls Cross

Heidi is extremely proud to have had her home garden recently photographed for a forthcoming feature in the RSPB magazine entitled: "Nature's Choice: showcasing what can be achieved in a very small space", see the [Gallery] ({% link _pages/gallery.md %}) page.

## Duncan West

Duncan and I work well together as a team, both having a similar outlook towards gardening but also having our own unique skill set. Duncan is especially skilled at design, rose pruning and box topiary while Heidi has vast plant knowledge and specialises in herbaceous perennials and plant suggestions.

Duncan has been gardening for over six years, both on his own and as part of other teams.

Duncan enjoys the design aspect of gardening -  having designed multiple gardens through to completion -  as well as maintenance and particularly excels in topiary, crown lifting and having a great eye for seeing a garden’s true potential. 

Heidi and Duncan have worked together for several years and their skills compliment each other’s strengths and abilities. Duncan is an easy going, conscientious gardener that takes great pride in his work no matter what the job entails.

He has also transformed his own long, shady garden into a quiet Japanese-style space complete with running stream!

### Horticulture Qualifcations
Duncan passed the *RHS Level 2 Practical* in 2013, at [Brinsbury College](https://chichester.ac.uk/brinsbury),  and also studied border design at Merrist Wood and tree care at Wisley.
