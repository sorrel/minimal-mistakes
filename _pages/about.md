## Heidi Hurwood

Heidi has been gardening for sixteen years, starting with her own allotment in the early 2000s followed by several years volunteering at Ryton Garden Organic before gardening professionally.

I have been a professional gardener for six years, gaining a wealth of experience in the many gardens I have cared for, with a particular focus on pruning. Every garden is different with:
 * a huge variety of plants 
 * different aspects and shading
 * varied soil types/nutrient requirements

Every client has their own ideas about how they would like me to care for their garden and I enjoy working with them to translate this into horticultural success. I liaise closely with my clients and have been praised for my plant knowledge, reliability and general interest.

Leaf & Seed have cared for a number of publically accessible gardens including:
 * *Haglands Lane*, West Chiltington
 * *The Roundabout Hotel*, West Chiltington
 * *Foxmead Court Retirement Homes*, Storrington
 * *Stag Cottage Bed & Breakfast*, Balls Cross

Heidi is extremely proud to have had her home garden recently photographed for a forthcoming feature in the RSPB magazine entitled: "Nature's Choice: showcasing what can be achieved in a very small space", see the [Gallery]({% link _pages/gallery.md %}) page.
