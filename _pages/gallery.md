All photos below taken as part of my gardening work. Please click on an image to learn more about the work, plant or wildlife involved.

## RSPB Magazine Photoshoot
My home garden was recently photographed for an as yet-to-be-published feature about small wildlife gardens in *Natures Home*, the [RSPB Magazine](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/natures-home-magazine/). 

The photos in this section were all taken by Andy Hay, with [Adrian Thomas](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adrian-Thomas/e/B0034N9EJ8%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share).
